# Tutorials

Scripts in this directory are intended to facilitate network development and testing by new users.
Basic tutorials will introduce and drill into the following features:


* Components: neurons (spiking, analog), synapses (STDP).
* Configuration: dictionary/YAML API, parameter sweeps.
* Simulation: pipelines, network API.
* Input: current injection, data loading & synthesis.
* Visualization: tensorboard.


Advanced tutorials may include:

* Numeric Approximation (Euler vs. RK4).
* Neuromorphic Normalization (Analog).
* Oscillators and Pyramidal-Interneuron Gamma (PING).
* Exploring Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP).

* Feedforward Networks (LIF/IZ).
* Recurrent Networks (LIF/IZ).

* Olfactory Bulb Model.
