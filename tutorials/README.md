# Tutorials

Scripts in this directory are intended to facilitate network development and testing by new users.

* Components: neurons (spiking, analog), synapses (STDP).
* Configuration: dictionary/YAML API, parameter sweeps.
* Simulation: pipeline, network, and model API.
* Input: data loading and synthesis.
* Visualization: matplotlib and tensorboard (legacy).

Covered topics include:

* Numeric approximation (Euler vs. RK4).
* Oscillators and pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING).
* Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
* Setting up recurrent networks of LIF/IZ neurons.
* Designing cross validated simulation experiments.
