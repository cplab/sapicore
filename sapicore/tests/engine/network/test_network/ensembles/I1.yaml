  identifier: I1
  # number of oscillators in this ensemble.
  num_units: 2
  # number of sine components going into each oscillator.
  num_wave_comps: 3

  sweep:
    # our network is listening to two alternating pure sine chords, C#m and B.
    zipped:
      # in this example, single note amplitudes are equal.
      amplitudes: [[5.0, 5.0, 5.0], [5.0, 5.0, 5.0]]
      # frequency combinations going into each oscillator unit.
      frequencies: [[34.6, 41.2, 51.9], [30.9, 36.7, 46.2]]
      # phase shifts for each frequency component, to be multiplied by np.pi (all zeros by default).
      phases: [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
      # couple the amplitude of each frequency component to these frequencies (optional, may run without amp_freq).
      amp_freq: [[2.0, 2.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0, 2.0]]
