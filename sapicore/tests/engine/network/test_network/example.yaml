# This is a model-simulation configuration file, with an identifier and two sections: `model` architecture and
# `simulation` logic. It describes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) network consisting of four ensembles and an
# analog oscillator input layer.

# Name of experiment/model.
identifier: Synth

# Full path to project directory. If a relative path is provided, assumes the root is ../sapinet.
root: tests/engine/network/test_network

# Model architecture.
model:
  # Paths to ensemble configuration files. Can be absolute or relative to `root`.
  ensembles:
    # Analog oscillator layer, generates input.
    - ensembles/I1.yaml
    # First LIF spiking neuron layer.
    - ensembles/L1.yaml
    # E/I-coupled LIF spiking neuron layers.
    - ensembles/L2.yaml
    - ensembles/L3.yaml
    # Readout LIF spiking neuron layer.
    - ensembles/L4.yaml

  # Paths to synapse configuration files. Can be absolute or relative to `root`.
  synapses:
    - synapses/I1->L1.yaml
    - synapses/L1->L2.yaml
    - synapses/L2->L2.yaml
    - synapses/L2->L3.yaml
    - synapses/L3->L2.yaml

# Simulation settings.
simulation:
  # Number of simulation steps.
  steps: 1000

  # Input current signatures. Current values within each internal list will be smeared to fit the number of simulation steps.
  # The i-th current time series will go into the i-th neuron of the ensemble specified as a key.
  # Here, a constant current of 0.0 is added to each of the membrane voltages of the oscillator units in I1.
  current:
    I1: [[0.0], [0.0]]

  # `True` for default data directory structure under `root`, `False` if not interested in logging simulation data to disk at all--overrides individual network component YAML `disk` setting.
  disk: True

  # How data should be written to tensorboard for visualization (can be `False` or omitted).
  # By default, all files in the output directory are scanned. If you would like to disable logging
  # for a specific network component, you can do that by editing the `disk` field in its YAML.
  tensorboard:
    - spiked:
        kind: raster
        format: image

    - voltage:
        kind: trace
        format: scalar

    - output:
