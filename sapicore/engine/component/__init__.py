        Note

        If a `sweep` key is not present in `configuration`, this method will pass silently, retaining the existing
        configurable values. It can be invoked safely from generic methods (e.g.,
        :meth:`~engine.network.Network.build`).

        num_combinations: int
            Total number of combinations to return.

        unravel: bool
            When the property is a 2D tensor, dictates whether combination values should be assigned
            to individual elements (True) or overwrite entire rows (False).

            The former behavior is appropriate for synapse attributes. It is achieved using `numpy.unravel_index`,
            which maps flattened-like indices to their nD equivalents given the shape of the array.

            The latter behavior is called for when values are themselves 1D vectors (e.g., oscillator frequencies).
