class Synapse(Component):
    """Static synapse base class.

    This class provides basic parameters and logic for connecting ensemble instances. Static synapses keep their
    initial weights throughout the simulation unless manually adjusted. Synapse instances have 2D weight and
    connectivity matrices, reflecting their role as layer-to-layer connectors.

    Synapses own the following parameters, over and above those inherited from :class:`~engine.component.Component`:

    Parameters
    ----------
    src_ensemble: Neuron
        Reference to the presynaptic (sending) ensemble.

    dst_ensemble: Neuron
        Reference to postsynaptic ensemble (receiving) ensemble.

    weights: Tensor
        2D weight matrix.

    connections: Tensor.
        2D connectivity mask matrix.

    weight_max: float or Tensor
        Positive weight value limit for any synapse element (applies throughout the simulation).

    weight_min: float or Tensor
        Negative weight value limit for any synapse element (applies throughout the simulation).

    delay_ms: float or Tensor
        Generic transmission delay, managed by the synapse object using queues.
        Transmission delays are useful for some temporal coding schemes.

    simple_delays: bool
        Whether transmission delay values from one presynaptic element are the same for all postsynaptic targets.
        Provides a speed-control tradeoff (one matrix multiplication vs. N vector multiplications).

    weight_init_method: Callable
        Weight initialization method from `torch.nn.init`.

    connections: Tensor
        2D binary integer mask matrix indicating which source unit -> destination unit connections are enabled.
        Loggable attribute.

    weights: Tensor
        2D float matrix storing a weight for each pair of source and destination ensemble units.
        Loggable attribute.

    output: Tensor
        1D tensor storing the result of W*x matrix multiplication in the current simulation step.
        Loggable attribute.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mode: str
            Sapicore provides four built-in connectivity mask initialization options: "all", "one", "prop", "rand".
            "all" enables all connections (matrix of 1s) except self-connections (diagonal) if the destination and
            source ensemble are the same object. "one" connects the i-th source neuron to the i-th destination neuron,
            zeroing out all matrix elements **except** the diagonal. "prop" connects each source neuron to
            `prop`*`dst_ensemble.num_units` randomly selected destination neurons. "rand" sets a proportion `prop`
            of the matrix elements to 1 with no balance constraints (unlike "prop").

        prop:
            Desired proportion a neurons in destination receiving a connection from a particular neuron
            in the source ensemble. Rounded to an integer using np.round.

            E.g., if prop = 0.2 and matrix_shape is (100, 5), 20 random row elements (destination neurons)
            in the connectivity mask will be set to 1.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `mode` was set to a value other than "all", "one", "prop", or "rand".

        Warning
        -------
        Attempting to initialize one-to-one connectivity between ensembles of different sizes will necessarily
        result in some unconnected neurons. The faux-diagonal will be set to 1s but there will be all 0s rows/cols,

        `src_ensemble.num_units` is maintained, as opposed to `src_ensemble.matrix_shape`.

        If `simple_delays` is toggled **off**, each neuron in the recipient ensemble may have a different delayed
        view of the source ensemble activity. This means that N vector multiplications must be performed:
        sig(W[k,i]*dd[i]) where N is the number of elements in the source ensemble, k the index of a destination
        element, i the index of a source element, W a weight, and dd the delayed data transmitted from the
